# Support Notice

Because of recent Apple anouncements that will remove skeumorphism, LDGradientButton will not be supported in iOS 7. As a replacement, I would recommend looking into live blur buttons which seem to be the new way of iOS. Thank you for your interest.

If you still want to use on iOS 7, the gradients will automatically be converted a solid color with an outline.

# LDGradientButton

LDGradientButton is meant to be a replacement for the Apple stock UIButton. It can easily be created either programmatically or with the Storyboard. It also supports the UIAppearence protocol for setting the tint color.

## Examples

### Button With Specific Tint Color
```objc
LDGradientButton *gradientButton = [[LDGradientButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 100)];
gradientButton.tintColor = [UIColor orangeColor];

[self.view addSubview:gradientButton];
```

### Button With Specific Colors
```objc
LDGradientButton *gradientButton = [[LDGradientButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 150, 50)];
gradientButton.title = @"Example Button";
gradientButton.normalTextColor = [UIColor blackColor];
gradientButton.highlightTextColor = [UIColor grayColor];
gradientButton.topColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.98f green:0.98f blue:0.98f alpha:1.00f];
gradientButton.bottomColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.87f green:0.87f blue:0.87f alpha:1.00f];
gradientButton.borderColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    
[self.view addSubview:gradientButton];
```

## Customization
### UIAppearence
LDGradientButton supports setting a global tint color default for all of the LDGradientButtons in an entire app.
```objc
[[LDGradientButton appearance] setTintColor:[UIColor redColor]];
```

### Properties
Here are the properties that you can set on each LDGradientButton:

* title
* tintColor (recalculates border color and button gradient)
* borderColor
* topColor & bottomColor (used to calculate the normal and highlight gradient)
* normalTextColor & highlightTextColor
